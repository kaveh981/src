# Project Atwater
Project Atwater is an API that allows buyers (advertisers, trading desks, DSPs) to purchase and negotiate deals with publishers.

# Setup
In order to run Atwater, you will need to follow the instructions in our [Setup Guide](http://confluence.indexexchange.com/display/ATW/Setup) and its sub-pages.
They detail how to setup our repository on your local machine and how to set up a running version of our API on your docker virtual machine.

# Structure
Atwater's project structure is currently divided into the following components:
- `api/`
    - contains source code, configuration, unit tests, and any other files that are only related to API functionality
- `docs/`
    - contains any project documentation, which is mainly API specifications at this point
- `nginx/`
    - contains configuration files for the NGINX instance
- `test/`
    - contains all end-to-end tests and test suites for the project
